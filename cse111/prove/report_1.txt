            Time Spent
   Date       (hours)   Description of Work
----------  ----------  -------------------------
not sure :(     2         Brainstorming with friends and classmates on what project I could do
                1         Planned out what I wanted the program to do
                2         Started coding
                3         Debugging code


2. Write the names of the functions in your program.
    print_main_menu()
    sort_books()
    read_dict()
    print_dict()
    add_book()
    remove_book()

3. Answer the following questions about the functions in your program.
    a. Does each function perform a single task?
    yes

    b. Does the name of each function describe or convey the task?
    yes

    c. Do most of your program functions have parameters and return a result?
    no
    If you answered "no" to any of the above three questions, what are
    you planning to change in your program?
    A lot of my program is printing things out for the user. Maybe I could split up something in main where I ask for an input and use that as something to return. 

4. Write the names of the test functions that you wrote to test your
program functions.
