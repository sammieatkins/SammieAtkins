    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to have a space where potential customers can come to learn more about white water rafting and book appointments if they are interested. </p>
    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <!-- <p>My audience will be adventurous people who want a high adrenaline experience. I'm assuming they will be single males, age 18-30 and that they will come in friend groups. Most of my audience will be in college still. </p> -->
    <p>My audience will be families who want to go white water rafting on vacation.
      The person likely to be on the website are a parent, age 40-50 (likely their children will be old enough to handle white water rafting at that point.) 
      They are most likely well off financially if they can afford to pay for a family white water rafting vacation. My audience will probably access my website via laptop/desktop.

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
