      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I want to make a website that supports people with food allergies in general, and also information specifically geared towards college students. It will give them advice on how to handle transitioning to college with food allergies. How to handle roommates, living situations, food preparation, etc. It would also have tips for roommates, parents, friends, or others who want to support a person with food allergies during that transition. I have life-threatening food allergies, and I also have experience with the process of adjusting to college. It's a big transition, and I would love to share what I've learned so far. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My primary audience will be college students, likely college beginners, with food allergies or other food sensitivities. I think the content of this website will also interest their families, roommates, friends, significant others, or anyone else who wants to support them. I think my audience will most likely be accessing this from a phone.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        FIRST AID:<br><br>
        1) Locate and give epinephrine FIRST<br><br>
        2) THEN call 911<br><br>
        3) Call family/friends/emergency contacts<br><br>
        Yes, you call 911 SECOND. This is different than treatment for other emergencies. In the case of anaphylaxis, there is literally no time to waste. <br><br>

        OTHER (optional):<br>
        - If you think of it, make a note of when exactly you started noticing symptoms. The paramedics often ask about this when they arrive. They also may ask what caused the reaction, so make a note of what food was eaten. Keep in mind, this information isn’t necessary for treatment so it’s okay if you don’t think to keep track, but it can be useful information to have.<br>
        - AFTER they are safe, maybe grab some comfy clothes, a blanket, a book, a charger… and anything you think your person with food allergies might like to have while they wait (potentially) 4 hours being monitored at the hospital. Trust me, it’s boring (still go though lol). <br>
        - At the hospital - you may have to fight the doctors on this one, but in my experience it’s worth it. Recently for my last few reactions the ER doctors not only have stopped requiring a 4 hour stay to monitor for a rebound reaction, but they’ve encouraged me to leave if I’m feeling fine. I strongly suggest you advocate for staying the whole 4 hours, because it is much better to find yourself having a rebound reaction in the ER rather than having to repeat the three steps above and go through it all over again.<br>

      <h3>Top 8 Things for a Student with Food Allergies to Bring to College</h3>
      <p>
        1) Washi tape!! - you can use this to mark out your spaces so that people know not to mix their stuff with yours. I put some in the fridge, on my soap by the sink, on my section of the cupboard with cleaning supplies. I also highly recommend taking a section of the counter and taping it off for just your use. This has been a lifesaver for me. <br>
        2) SO MANY EPIPENS - bring allllllll of your epipens. I have one by my bed, a set in my backpack, and a set in my kitchen and all my roommates know where to find it. Even bring the expired ones, you can use those to train your roommates using a grapefruit or large orange. <br>
        3) Allegra/benadryl/equivalent - sometimes the seasonal allergies just hit people, especially when you’re in a new place with new pollens <br>
        4) Clorox wipes - you need a quick and easy way to decontaminate stuff!! Clorox wipes are perfect for this. I’ll just wipe off my square of the counter top real quick before I prep my food and it soooo helps with my peace of mind. My apartment also does clean checks, so it makes that easy as well :). I would recommend having some out in the open for your roommates to use, and then your own so you don’t have to touch the contaminated one. <br>
        5) Your own paper towels/kitchen towels. NEVER use the oven towel. No matter how conscious your roommates are, it’s likely they’ll forget they have *dangerous* eggy residue on their hands and wipe it off on the communal towel hanging on the oven door. Just use your own!! Keep it in your cupboard or a drawer so no one else uses it. You could even put it on a command hook by your square of the counter. <br>
        6) Your own kitchen things - for obvious reasons, I would not recommend sharing any kitchen utensils. <br>
        7) Microwave - you can’t expect other people to keep a clean microwave, and the best solution I came up with was to have my own allergen-free microwave.<br>
        8) Toaster - similar situation to the microwave. The communal toaster is simply a breeding ground for cross contamination. <br><br><br>

        General easy asks from roommates: <br><br>
        - If they’re going to leave dishes in the sink, ask them to keep it on the non-disposal side so you can still have a space to wash your hands without a panic attack :)<br>
        - Offer to keep paper products (plates, utensils, napkins, etc.) for communal use so that if your roommate wants to be lazy and not do dishes after eating a peanut butter sandwich, the whole contaminated mess can just be thrown out instead of sitting in the sink for days… oh the joys of college life ;)<br>
        - In my apartment we have clean checks, and I asked to not be put on the rotation for cleaning the kitchen. I also don’t take out the kitchen trash. Mostly because those things make me really nervous when it comes to coming in contact with my allergens. This doesn’t mean I don’t clean!! I clean the bathroom, the vanity area, and the living room on a rotation. You can still help out without being stressed out. <br><br><br>

        Other tips:<br><br>
        - Roommate meeting - Take it from me, it is SO worth it to initiate a roommate meeting within the first week of the semester where you can all talk about your expectations for each other. This doesn’t have to be a big “hey I have food allergies and here are all the things you have to do because of it >:(“. Everyone has things they don’t like. Maybe someone really hates hair on the wall, or you want to decide what days everyone will do laundry. Or maybe you can decide when your apartment's quiet hours will be. This can be useful for everyone, not just you. Besides, it’s a perfect time to bring up some of the easy asks listed above and to do a little training on food allergies. My first semester I was too nervous to initiate one and I regretted it. It would’ve made my life so much less stressful if I had just asked for what I needed from the beginning. <br>
        - Microwave/Toaster Final Tip - Consider keeping the microwave and toaster in your room if you can. Then people won’t use it unknowingly. If you can’t manage that, then be sure to discuss it with your roommates and perhaps put a sign on it so you don’t have to tell everyone who comes into the apartment haha. You could even decorate it!! If you’re like me, you could use all those stickers you’re too scared to put on your water bottle ;)<br>
        - Emergency Contacts - Write your emergency contacts down somewhere easily visible so that if you have an allergic reaction, whoever is with you will know who to call after administering epinephrine and calling 911. I keep my emergency contacts list taped to the inside of my cabinet that has my kitchen epipens. I showed my roommates where these things were at the roommate meeting at the beginning of the semester. <br>

      <h3>Personal Stories</h3>
      <p>
        I have life-threatening food allergies to eggs, peanuts, and treenuts. On this section of the page, I’ll be sharing some of my anaphylaxis experiences. <br><br><br>

        The choir performance one <br><br>

        This reaction happened in high school. It was a busy (and, spoiler alert, rough) weekend for me. On top of all the craziness I’m about to explain, I was in the process of getting my tooth that I broke in half fixed. So just keep in mind that I had a fake tooth that was barely holding on with some denture glue … a story for another day ;). Needless to say, there was a lot going on. 
        I was in the Rising Generation Youth Chorus, an audition only choir sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. We had one concert where after we sang, the members of the audience offered to let us eat pizza and hang out with the party. My friends and I found a table, scanning for one that didn’t have Reese’s peanut butter cups in the center, and we all sat down. After inquiring about if the pizza was safe to eat, I snatched a piece. Sadly I had to wait to eat it, because the fake tooth would have to come off for that and I was not ready to expose myself just yet. As soon as we got to the car, though, I pulled out my stupid tooth and dug in. <br>
        When I got home, my stomach was hurting. Almost like I had gas or something, so I went to lay down. After a while though, it became all too clear that this was not just some innocent case of a sore stomach. I honestly don’t remember much from this point on. Gotta love trauma responses. Something I do remember: the pain being so intense I was arching my back and I couldn’t move or speak. Keep in mind - this is not my usual reaction. It took us a while to recognize it for what it was because I’m used to my throat swelling up. I tend to have a quick reaction with minimal time to act or debate. Once it dawned on us (or rather, my parents since I was out of it), we rushed to the hospital. I had to be carried out of the car. On the way there, I started freaking out. It’s said that one of the symptoms of anaphylaxis is a “sense of impending doom” (see picture from FARE website). I started to experience that feeling, which was when we administered the epipen. This was the only reaction I had where I actually thought I was going to die. Thankfully, the epinephrine (a miracle drug) did the trick. <br>
        We made it to the hospital, and they took care of me. So there I am, waiting out my 4 hours in the hospital room, about half a front tooth to my name, alive and well. And they all lived happily ever after. <br>
        The thing about allergic reactions is it’s not always clear what exactly you reacted to. I’m still not sure what the allergen was that caused this one. There are two suspects: 1) perhaps some sort of egg thing in the actual pizza, or 2) aka the best guess: residue from Reese's peanut butter cups on the table. In hindsight, we realized we had bad logic about choosing a  table back at the event. We went to the table without peanut butter cups, without realizing that that would mean the Reese’s peanut butter cups had been eaten and therefore would have left residue on the table. <br><br><br>


        The driving one - a cautionary tale about assumptions <br><br>

        I was on my way to hang out with some friends when I decided I was hungry and wanted to stop by Taco Bell. I had always eaten there safely, so I didn’t think to ask about any egg or nut products. I don’t remember exactly what I ordered, but it had some sort of white sauce (which I didn’t realize until after the fact). I was ravenous, so I scarfed it down on my way to where my friends and I were going to meet up. That was my first mistake: eating while driving. Then when I got to the parking lot I finished off the last few bites before noticing the tell-tale signs of an allergic reaction for me. A peculiar feeling in my throat, nausea, increased saliva, overall sensation of impending doom. Ya know, the usual. Anyways, I immediately recognized the symptoms and pulled out my epipens, administered it to my outer thigh, and dialed 911 all within seconds. The ambulance found me in the parking lot a few minutes later. Thankfully, I’ve learned the skill of catching a reaction quickly, so there wasn’t much for the paramedics to do but take me to the hospital for monitoring (to make sure I don’t have a rebound reaction). This reaction was scary as always, but it was also a big confidence booster for me and my family to know that I can handle a reaction when I’m all alone (I hadn’t met up with my friends yet). This was a huge comfort for all of us when I left for college.
