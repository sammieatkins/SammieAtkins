            <p id="across_p">
                1) <b>SO MANY EPIPENS</b> - Bring allllllll of your epipens. I have one by my bed, a set in my backpack, and a set in my kitchen and all my roommates know where to find it. Even bring the expired ones, you can use those to train your roommates using a grapefruit or large orange.
            </p>
            <p>
                2) <b>Washi tape!!</b> - You can use this to mark out your spaces so that people know not to mix their stuff with yours. I put some in the fridge, on my soap by the sink, on my section of the cupboard with cleaning supplies. I also highly recommend taking a section of the counter and taping it off for just your use. This has been a lifesaver for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                3) <b>Your own kitchen things</b> - For cross-contamination reasons, I would not recommend sharing any kitchen utensils.
            </p>
            <p>
                4) <b>Allegra/benadryl/equivalent</b> - sometimes the seasonal allergies just hit people, especially when you’re in a new place with new pollens.
            </p>
            <p>
                5) <b>Paper towels/kitchen towels</b> - Have your own!! NEVER use the oven towel. No matter how conscious your roommates are, it’s likely they’ll forget they have *dangerous* eggy residue on their hands and wipe it off on the communal towel hanging on the oven door. Just use your own!! Keep it in your cupboard or a drawer so no one else uses it. You could even put it on a command hook by your square of the counter.
            </p>
            <p id="across_p">
                6) <b>Clorox wipes</b> - You need a quick and easy way to decontaminate stuff!! Clorox wipes are perfect for this. I just wipe off my square of the counter top real quick before I prep my food and it soooo helps with my peace of mind. My apartment also does clean checks, so it makes that easy as well :). I would recommend having some out in the open for your roommates to use, and then your own so you don’t have to touch the contaminated one.
            </p>
            <p id="across_p">
                7) <b>Microwave</b> - you can’t expect other people to keep a clean microwave, and the best solution I came up with was to have my own allergen-free microwave.
            </p>
            <p id="across_p">
                8) <b>Toaster</b> - similar situation to the microwave. The communal toaster is simply a breeding ground for cross contamination.
            </p>

                    Other tips:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    - <b>Roommate meeting</b> - Take it from me, it is SO worth it to initiate a roommate meeting within the first week of the semester where you can all talk about your expectations for each other. This doesn’t have to be a big “hey I have food allergies and here are all the things you have to do because of it“. Everyone has things they don’t like. Maybe someone really hates hair on the wall, or you want to decide what days everyone will do laundry. Or maybe you can decide when your apartment's quiet hours will be. This can be useful for everyone, not just you. Besides, it’s a perfect time to bring up some of the easy asks listed above and to do a little training on food allergies. My first semester I was too nervous to initiate one and I regretted it. It would’ve made my life so much less stressful if I had just asked for what I needed from the beginning. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    - <b>Microwave/Toaster Final Tip</b> - Consider keeping the microwave and toaster in your room if you can. Then people won’t use it unknowingly. If you can’t manage that, then be sure to discuss it with your roommates and perhaps put a sign on it so you don’t have to tell everyone who comes into the apartment haha. You could even decorate it!! If you’re like me, you could use all those stickers you’re too scared to put on your water bottle ;)
                </p>
                <p>
                    - <b>Emergency Contacts</b> - Write your emergency contacts down somewhere easily visible so that if you have an allergic reaction, whoever is with you will know who to call after administering epinephrine and calling 911. I keep my emergency contacts list taped to the inside of my cabinet that has my kitchen epipens. I showed my roommates where these things were at the roommate meeting at the beginning of the semester.

                <h2>
                    General easy asks from roommates:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    - If they’re going to leave dishes in the sink, ask them to keep it on the non-disposal side so you can still have a space to wash your hands or dishes without a panic attack :)
                </p>
                <p>
                    - In my apartment we have clean checks, and I asked to not be put on the rotation for cleaning the kitchen. I also don’t take out the kitchen trash. Mostly because those things make me really nervous when it comes to coming in contact with my allergens. This doesn’t mean I don’t clean!! I clean the bathroom, the vanity area, and the living room on a rotation. You can help out without being stressed out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Offer to keep paper products (plates, utensils, napkins, etc.) for communal use so that if your roommate wants to be lazy and not do dishes after eating a peanut butter sandwich, the whole contaminated mess can just be thrown out instead of sitting in the sink for days… oh the joys of college life ;)
